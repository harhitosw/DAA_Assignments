## DAA Assignments

- Implementation of some assignments in Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- Will be improvising the codes slowly and add more assignments in few days

## Disclaimer

- This repository is owned by Harsh Oswal.
- All these codes are done by Harsh Oswal and some codes are added by Om Londhe.
- We did these codes just to complete assignments, understand the problem statement and learn something new.
- These codes are non-standard implementation and are completely based on what we have learnt in class.
- Different implementations can be found on the internet.
- If any of these code is not accepted by an examiner in practical examination, then no one will be responsible.

## Instructions

- We wrote all the programs with little or no dependency of any library.
- If any program, in case needs any library, then it will be mentioned in the comments in that program.
